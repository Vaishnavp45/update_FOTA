Here we have done the task which is updating the firmware over the air through GitHub server and storing that files into SPIFFS partitions. First time the firmware will store into first and second partition and when we again try to update the firmware(means when we press EN button on ESP32) it will check the size and name of both old(which is into spiff's first partition) and new firmware(which is on server) and if size or name is different then it will transfer first partition's firmware into second partition and it will store new firmware taken from server into first partition and prints data from both partitions after updating.
