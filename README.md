Here we are updating firmware OTA and storing into SPIFFS partition, new will update in first partition and old will moved to second partition. When GPIO-13 is interrupted (connected to GND) then checking of update takes place and it will check for new updation from server. This code also contains GPIO-14 for interrupting and after interrupt of GPIO-14 the data from 2nd partition will be copied into 1st partition. This is considered as an error solving method after updating if any error is encountered in firmware then old firmware (which is stored in 2nd partition) will again moved into first partition.
